# Git Learn
## Reason I want to learn Git
Git is a distribution manager, It is one of the best tool for open source community and it will help a software develop to a great one. So I think every programmer should learn Git and GitHub which is a web repository for code manager. Even though I am a chinese, but I think if we should want to learn program well we have to learn english well. Firstly, English is another style word to describe the world and every complex word is consisted of 26 letter. And Chinese is another style word wich is consisted thousands of hunnreds of different word. As a Chinese I really want to code with chinese, but I can not image we use thousands of word to code the world. So I really want to learn English well
