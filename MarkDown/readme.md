# Learn MarkDown
As we all know MarkDown is the popular language use in github and we should know something about MarkDown which will help us to use github.

# The Syntax of Markdown
## Title
When we try to write something, we must write some title. We will write many title.

We will use `# First level title` to show
> # First level title

we will use `## Second level title` to show 
>## Second level title

we will use `### Third level title` to show 
>### Third level title

We totally have six title level.

## Cite
We can use `>` to cite something you cite from other website or you just want use this layout just as below:

>Do as Roman do!

## Picture and Link
If we want to add Picture in markdown, we have two way to load picture on markdown. Firstly we can use local way to load picture, but I recommand use the second way to load picture.

* Picture

When we want load picture in markdown, we had better to upload a picture in the internet, and I recommand we can create a folder in your github repository to store picture. which will help you can load the picture in markdown file everywhere you open.

And then we load picture in syntax as below:

`![text(what show if no picture)](url "title")`
